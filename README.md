# VLTI is easier than you tink!

If you have never done so, applying, observing and analysing data for [ESO](www.eso.org)'s [VLTI](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/vlti.html) can be intimidating... but worry no more! a team of young and diverse scientists has put together [some material](https://github.com/amerand/easyVLTI2025/blob/main/EAS_LS7_joint_slides.pdf) to help you get familiar with all the steps necessary to get your awesome astrophysical result with VLTI, so you can join the [nearly 600 refereed papers published with VLTI](https://telbib.eso.org/?boolany=or&boolaut=or&boolti=or&yearto=2025&boolins=or&telescope%5B%5D=%22VLTI%22&booltel=or&boolsite=or&search=Search) (as of mid-2025):

- What is optical interferometry and VLTI in particular (by Farin Drewes)
- Convert your idea into a proposal (by Evgenia Koumpia)
- Prepare your proposal: using [ESO phase 1](https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase1.html) (by Emma Bordier)
- Prepare your observations: using [ESO phase 2](https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase2.html) (by James Leftley)
- Reduce your data, by yourself or with the help of the VLTI expertise centres (by Foteini Claire Lykou)
- Analyse your data with open tools (by Jens Kammerer)

# Acknowledgments

This [slide show](https://github.com/amerand/easyVLTI2025/blob/main/EAS_LS7_joint_slides.pdf) was presented during the Session ["LS7: Your science with the VLTI: easier than you think!"](https://eas.unige.ch/EAS2025/session.jsp?id=LS7) at the European Astronomical Society meeting in June 27, 2025.

The session was coordinated by Antoine MÃ©rand, Foteini Claire Lykou and Rebeca Garcia-Lopez, with the support of the European Interferometry Initiative ([EII](https://european-interferometry.eu)) and the European Southern Observatory ([ESO](www.eso.org)).

- [SearchCal](https://www.jmmc.fr/english/tools/proposal-preparation/search-cal/): calibrators need to be provided at phase 2!

## Data reduction
- [ESO archive](https://archive.eso.org/eso/eso_archive_main.html) for raw data
- ESO pipelines for [GRAVITY](https://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/gravity/), [MATISSE](https://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/matisse/), including documentation and cookbooks
- links to additional tools (e.g. python scripting for pipelines) for [PIONIER](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/pionier/tools.html), [GRAVITY](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/gravity/tools.html) and [MATISSE](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/matisse/tools.html)
- JMMC's database of reduced data [OiDB](https://www.jmmc.fr/english/tools/data-bases/oidb/)

## Utilities
- General utilities from JMMC such as [Aspro2](https://www.jmmc.fr/~betaswmgr/Aspro2/): observations planning and simulation (a must!) or [OIFITS-explorer](https://www.jmmc.fr/english/tools/data-analysis/oifits-explorer/), a simple viewer for OIFITS files.
- The OIFITSv2 format is described in [Duvert et al. (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...597A...8D/abstract)

## Model fitting
- Basic tools such as [LITpro](https://www.jmmc.fr/apps/public/LITpro/) (basic model fitting with graphical interface) or [CANDID](https://github.com/amerand/CANDID): Companion detection and and upper limit
- More complex modeling (e.g. arbitrary combinations of components, chromatic, spectroscopic, time variable) check out [fouriever](https://github.com/kammerje/fouriever), [PMOIRED](https://github.com/amerand/PMOIRED) or [OIMODELER](https://github.com/oimodeler/oimodeler)

## Image reconstruction
- [OIMAGING](https://www.jmmc.fr/english/tools/data-analysis/oimaging/): a wrapper for image reconstruction tools such as [MiRA](https://github.com/emmt/MiRA), [SQUEEZE](https://github.com/fabienbaron/squeeze) or [BSMEM](https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/ResearchFacilities/software-for-astrophyiscs/bsmem)
- Newer tools include machine learning, like [Organic](https://github.com/DePrinsT/organic) or [CASSINI](https://github.com/cosmosz5/CASSINI)
